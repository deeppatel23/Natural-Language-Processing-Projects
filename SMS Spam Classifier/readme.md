The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.
Here, I used Naive Bayes and SVM models to test the dataset. I found that NAive Bayes works best with 98% accuracy.
